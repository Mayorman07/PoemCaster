    "Where all alike roamed",
    "Cupid rolled that i die a lonely minister",
    "Treacherous trickster",
    "All the gods played their hands",
    "Diswagered for the torment of my weary soul",
    "My misreable fate , the sport of amusement",
    "My only ally, the Colosseum",
    "Pregnant with deafening cheers",
    "Impartial to my misery",
    "Held my secret",
    "Their steps carried the weight of my chosen",
    "Whose kiss could give life",
    "But stole mine",
    "Now im left a hollow being",
    "Doomed to death"

    "Venice, the city of masks and dreams,",
    "The morning sun pales in comparison to the radiance of my fair maiden",
    "Who sat by the cascading waterfall, enthralling dull strays",
    "Her presence the perfect depiction of zen in Eden's garden",
    "Da Vinci waited for the moment to capture her ethereal beauty",
    "Many line like sugar ants for the jewel they cannot possess",
    "Eager to be conscripted for duty",
    "Protecting the queen from a mindless game of chess",
    "Swans hiss at the grace in her step",
    "Her scent reels in all alike, putting flowers to shame",
    "At the call of her name, kings flex their biceps",
    "Seeking the glory of fame",

    "I don't pray timid prayers when it comes to you",
    "I ask the Almighty to steel my mind, temper my heart, and make me the kind of man",
    "Who's love you can feel in your bones",
    "May your life overflow with blessings, but may you also know",
    "There is a place carved for you in the quiet storms inside me",
    "Your presence makes my pulse misbehave",
    "Your absence makes my spirit restless ",
    "Be mine and mine alone, through the dusk , through the dawn, and far beyond the grip of time",
    "And i will be yours, through temptation, through shadows, through every stolen breath and treasured kiss",
    "Until the end refuses to come",

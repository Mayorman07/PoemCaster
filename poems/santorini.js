    "Hide your wives",
    "Guard your heart",
    "The sea remembers what men forget",
    "He comes with the dusk - skin kissed by the sun",
    "He has eyes that have seen kingdoms fall",
    "He doesn't chase. He calls - and souls obey",
    "They say he was forged where desire met damnation",
    "A pilgrim of pleasure , raking the coals of hell for warmth",
    "She met him  on the edge of the caldera, where the wind carries the whispers of the drowned",
    "He touched her - and the fire did not burn",
    "By morning, she wore her tan like an oath",
    "An Santorini kept another secret benesth its white walls"

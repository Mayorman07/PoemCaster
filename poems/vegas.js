    "Sex so intimate it feels like electrocution - a beautiful kind of death",
    "Shes the woman from his dreams, and he follows her like a sleepwalker, half under her spell and half under his own ruins",
    "But she's no dream",
    "She's hunger in heels",
    "A nightwalker who feeds on men who still belive in control",
    "Every touch erases him a little more",
    "Ever kiss rewires his conscience",
    "Discipline . Faith. Promises. All gone - scorched under the red hum of Vegas",
    "Could this be love? Hell no!!",
    "This is worship, and worship always ends in ashes"
